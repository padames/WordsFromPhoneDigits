# WordsFromPhoneDigits
Transform a string representing a phone number into all of the possible words according to a digit to character mapping.

The mapping is as follows:

```
digit_to_characters <- c("1" = "", "2" = "abc", "3" = "def", "4" = "ghi",
                         "5" = "jkl", "6" = "mno", "7" = "pqrs",
                         "8" = "tuv", "9" = "wxyz", "0" = "")


```
